# Python-Movie-Corelation-Project

I. Objective:

Use the plots to check out correlations such as gross, invest, brand, company, actor, etc. to figure out whether the money invested or the company is the best factor to help the companies earn profit or the other factors will affect the revenue of the movie.

II. Process:

a. General ways to solve the problem:
  After checking the missing data and dropping the duplicates I will use the Scatter plot, Seaborn (showing the line of correlation), Pearson, and Pairs comma to figure out the correlation between the gross and the rating, the gross and the name of the company, and the gross and the budget, etc.

b. The process of solving.

1. Checking any missing data.

2. Drop the duplicated values.

3. Create a scatter plot to check the correlation between the budget and the gross.

4. Plot budget and gross using seaborn (showing the line of correlation).

5. Use the Pearson method to check the correlations.

6. Use the Matrix method (Heatmap) to check the correlations.

7. Change all types of data into numbers to check the correlations.

8. Show the correlations with the Pairs method.

III. Result:

After checking the results, and visualizations we can conclude that between votes and gross, and budget and gross have a high correlation. Other than that, Company and Rating have a low correlation with the gross.
